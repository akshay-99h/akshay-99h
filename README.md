## Hey, I’m a full‑stack dev from India 👋

Mid-level **full‑stack** developer from India, working mostly with modern JavaScript/TypeScript, scalable backends, and cloud infrastructure.  
Building production apps, shipping on AWS, and experimenting with AI, offline‑first UX, and better DevOps workflows.

---

## What I work with

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, a bit of Bash.  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, NestJS, REST APIs, auth, payments, webhooks.  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, modern SPA/SSR apps with good DX and performance.  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS), MongoDB; schema design, migrations, query tuning.  
- **Infra & DevOps**: Docker, AWS ECS, load balancers, SSL/ACM, CI/CD, infra‑as‑code experiments.  
- **Tooling**: GitHub, GitHub Actions, pnpm, Husky, macOS dev setup.

## Some things I’ve built

- **Game analytics dashboards** – Real-time events, leaderboards, and admin tooling
- **Full-fledged payment platform** – Wallets, transactions, mobile recharges, flight bookings, and admin reconciliation
- **Food ordering platform** – Multi-role system with customers, restaurants, delivery partners, and admins  
- **Internal admin & node-based tools** – Scenario builders, conditional flows, and content management  
- **Scaffolding & DX tools** – Opinionated backend starters with security, linting, and Git hooks  
- **Auth & role-based systems** – Secure access control across multiple user roles  
- **Real-time & offline-first apps** – WebSockets, PWAs, IndexedDB, and caching strategies  
- **AI-powered prototypes** – LLM integrations, micro-feeds, and RAG-style experiments  
- **CI/CD & deployments** – Dockerized services, cloud setups, and release pipelines  

Production code, quick prototypes, and “learning in public” experiments live here.

## What I’m exploring right now

- Getting deeper into **system design** and scalable backend patterns.  
- Better **agentic AI** and LLM integration in real products, not just demos.  
- Cleaner **DevOps** pipelines and cost‑effective cloud setups for side projects.
- Turning ideas into **well‑designed, scalable products** – from UX flows and pricing to architecture that can handle real traffic.Z
